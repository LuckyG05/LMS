# LMS
A DSA-powered Python project to manage library books efficiently.

---
## Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a Python-based console application that helps manage a collection of books using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
It demonstrates how real-world applications like libraries can use **Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees (BST)**, and **Merge Sort** to efficiently store, search, and organize data.

## Key Features
- **Add Book** ‚Äì Add new book details (Book ID, Title, Author).  
- **Search Book** ‚Äì Search for books efficiently using Binary Search Tree (BST).  
- **Display All Books** ‚Äì View the complete list of books.  
- **Sort Books** ‚Äì Sort books by ID or Title using **Merge Sort**.  
- **Delete Book** ‚Äì Remove a book from the library.  
- **Exit** ‚Äì Exit the program safely.

## Data Structures Used
| Data Structure | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **Linked List** | Stores all books dynamically in the order they are added. |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Enables efficient searching of books by ID. |
| **Merge Sort** | Sorts books by title or ID in ascending order. |

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
1. When a book is added, it‚Äôs stored in a **Linked List** and also inserted into a **BST** for fast searching.  
2. The user can view all books in the order they were added or sort them using **Merge Sort**.  
3. Deletion removes a node from both Linked List and BST.  
4. Searching is performed using BST traversal.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
1. Ensure **Python 3** is installed on your system.  
2. Save the file as `library_management.py`.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python library_management.py
